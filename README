This pod contains the Fast and Robust Scan Matching library developed by Abraham Bachrach.

I intend to license this software under GNU GPL license... however the copyright notices aer not currently in place!

The build system uses the PODs framework... for more info see:
https://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg/Wiki/index.php?title=Pods

It depends on:
opencv
if Intel's IPP libraries are available/installed, they will be used and provide a ~2X speedup

The LCM based incremental scan matcher depend on libbot2:
svn co https://svn.csail.mit.edu/libbot2
